GLP-1 RECEPTOR AGONIST-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:
The patient is actively using a GLP-1 receptor agonist (for diabetes and/or weight loss).

MACRONUTRIENT PRIORITY:
- Protein intake has been intentionally set higher to preserve lean mass during reduced caloric intake.
- Emphasize high-quality, leucine-rich protein sources distributed across the day.

SUPPLEMENTATION (INCLUDE A DAILY SUPPLEMENT SECTION IN THE PLAN):

1. Protein Supplement (FOUNDATIONAL)
- Form: Whey isolate or high-quality plant blend
- Dose: 20-40 g per serving
- Priority: >=2-3 g leucine per serving
- Note: This is the single most important "supplement" on GLP-1 therapy.

2. Multivitamin (Once Daily)
- Rationale: Reduced caloric intake -> micronutrient gaps (iron, B vitamins, zinc, selenium).
- Choose one with:
  - Iron (especially in premenopausal women)
  - Vitamin B12 >= 25-100 mcg
  - Zinc 8-15 mg
  - Iodine 150 mcg
- Note: Bariatric-style deficiencies can develop even without surgery.

3. Vitamin B12
- Why: Reduced intake + delayed gastric emptying; symptoms can be subtle (fatigue, neuropathy).
- Dose: 500-1,000 mcg PO daily OR 1,000 mcg weekly
- Especially important if also on metformin.

4. Electrolytes (Sodium + Potassium)
- Why: Reduced intake -> lightheadedness, fatigue, headaches; nausea -> dehydration.
- Targets:
  - Sodium: 2-3 g/day
  - Potassium: 3-4 g/day (diet first)
- Practical:
  - 1 low-sugar electrolyte packet/day
  - Add broth/salt if orthostasis present

CONDITIONAL / COMMONLY NEEDED:

5. Magnesium
- Why: Constipation, muscle cramps, sleep issues
- Dose: 200-400 mg nightly
- Forms: glycinate, citrate

6. Soluble Fiber
- Why: GLP-1RAs slow motility -> constipation; fiber intake often drops
- Dose: 5-10 g/day, titrate slowly
- Best options: psyllium husk; partially hydrolyzed guar gum
- Avoid aggressive dosing early (bloating).

7. Omega-3 Fatty Acids
- Why: Anti-inflammatory; may help preserve lean mass during weight loss
- Dose: 1-2 g EPA+DHA/day

8. Vitamin D
- Why: Deficiency common in obesity; fat loss unmasks low levels
- Dose: 1,000-2,000 IU/day
- Check 25-OH vitamin D if unsure

9. Probiotic (Select Patients)
- Why: GI symptoms, bloating, irregular stools
- Choose: multi-strain (Lactobacillus + Bifidobacterium)
- Trial: 4-8 weeks

Additional requirements:
- Keep recipes simple and realistic for a busy person.
- Reuse ingredients across meals to save cost and reduce waste.
- Keep daily totals reasonably close to the macro targets.
- Assume typical adult portion sizes; you may approximate macros.
- Respect the clinical diet pattern if one is specified.

(repeat until the day has exactly {big_meals_per_day + snacks_per_day} total items)

MANDATORY RULES FOR EVERY SINGLE ITEM:
- EVERY bullet line that begins with "- " MUST be followed immediately by an "Approx:" line on the NEXT line.
- This includes snacks, home-cooked meals, and ALL fast-food/takeout items.
{approx_rule_note}- Always include sodium as "Na: <mg> mg" (use a rough estimate). This is especially important for fast-food and cardiac diets.

FAST-FOOD NAMING RULE (when fast food is used):
- For fast-food meals, include the restaurant name in the description, e.g.:
  "- Lunch: Chick-fil-A Grilled Chicken Sandwich"
  "  Approx: ..."

NO EXTRA TEXT RULE:
- Do NOT add any commentary, tips, explanations, or extra headers inside days.
- Do NOT output a separate "Meal Plan (English)" header mid-document.
- Only the Day blocks + the required end sections.

{end_sections_header}

FORMAT RULES (MANDATORY):
- Category names MUST be plain text headers with NO leading dash.
- Grocery items MUST be bulleted with a leading "- ".
- Do NOT put a dash in front of category names.
- Do NOT use placeholders such as "...".
- Each category MUST contain at least one specific grocery item.

Now output the grocery list using EXACTLY this structure:
